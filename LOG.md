# LOG


### FRIDAY 8 JUNE
9 - 11pm: Spent ages trying to import project into Eclipse/get cucumber working. Couldn't get it to work, so I switched to IntelliJ. Initial push.


### SATURDAY 9 JUNE
3 - 7pm: Reading over entire spec + investigating into domain + trying to figure out how program works/how to tackle it. Writing notes and trying to pick scenarios apart from the spec.


### SUNDAY 10 JUNE 
9pm - 1am: ENGR301 report+ MVP due prior to this. Been doing that all day... Began writing basic scenarios to intrduce myself to it. Spec has a lot of contradictions and I'm finding it hard to wade my way through this.


### MONDAY 11 JUNE
12 - 6pm: Writing more scenarios and trying to make sense of everything. Wrote basic scenarios for Mail covering delivery as well beginning mail priority methods. Some tests fail but I'm trying to stick to the data.xml and domain provided to us, and because of this my tests fail. Finding it hard to know the difference between my faults and the domains faults because of failing tests.  
8pm - 1am: Carried on writing scenarios to do with mail priority methods. (Finished I think...????)


### TUESDAY 12 JUNE
12 - 8pm: Writing scenarios. Finding it really hard to understand vague spec and contradictions.  
9pm - 2am: Writing scenarios. Tests failing all over the place. Not sure if theyre meant to fail or not.


### WEDNESDAY 13 JUNE
1 - 7pm: More scenarios. Absolute nightmare.
9 - 10:30pm: Report written. Guess I'll just write scenarios till hand in...
